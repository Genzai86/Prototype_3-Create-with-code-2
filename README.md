# Prototype_3-Create-with-code-2
The third practice with Unity
Practice minigame in which the player only presses the space bar to jump while obstacles are approaching. The background moves from right to left to create the sensation of movement. Dust particles are added while the player is running and a large cloud of dust is added when the player runs into a fence. Sound effects such as jump sound, crash sound and background music are added.
